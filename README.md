## Building the Website

### Programs Used
This website was built using [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). Similar to our Node project in class, this website uses Node, and its entry point is todo.ejs. 

### Packages Used
The following packages were used to create this website: express, ejs, and axios.

### APIs Used
Two APIs were used to create this website. The API used to generate the random cat image is [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). The API used to generate the random cat fact is [Cat Fact Ninja](https://catfact.ninja/).

## Running the Website

### The Website's Purpose
This website was created to inform people about cats and encourage people to adopt them. It aims to use the random image generator to entertain people while also generating interesting facts about cats.

### The Website's Flow
When the website first loads, users see an image of a random cat. Under the image is a randomly generated cat fact. These two features change with each re-load of the website. This keeps the information and images new for users. Under these two features are two helpful resources for those interested in learning more about caring for cats.
